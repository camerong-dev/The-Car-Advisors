        <p id="paragraph">Buying a second, third, or fourth-hand car can be a daunting experience. Whether you’re buying privately, online or through a reputable dealership, there’s always some worry about risks. You’re most likely forking out a good chunk of cash and you want as much reassurance as you can get that your new wheels are reliable and affordable.</p>
