# Motor Experts

Motor Experts is a site that provides guides and advice for all things relating to cars. This site is targeted towards hopeful car buyers and/or the general public who want to find out more information on particular aspects of a car. 

## Live Site
[Motor Experts](https://camerong-dev.github.io/motor-experts/)

## Project Goals

- Showcase my understanding and knowledge of HTML and CSS
- Build a static front-end application with a simple and easy to follow UI

## Site Structure

Motor Experts is a 3 page website, with the home page being the default loading page. All other pages are accessed from the navigation bar at any given time. 

## Colour Scheme

My colour scheme will follow a simple, yet stylish aesthetic using greys and greens. I used [Colormind](http://colormind.io/) to generate random colour palettes to find the initial colour. From there I used [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/) to create a variety of colour palettes based off of one colour that I provided. 

Final Colour Palette:

## Fonts

The two fonts used were imported into the style.css file from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Quicksand was used for h1 and h2 elements for it's basic yet stylish appearance, which ties into the overall design of the site. Nunito was used for all other text as it matched Quicksands stylish and simple design. Sans-serif was the backup due to the basic design, allowing to fit perfectly into the site if the other fonts do not load.
