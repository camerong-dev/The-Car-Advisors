# Portfolio Project 1 - HTML/CSS Essentials

## Live Site
[Motor Experts](https://camerong-dev.github.io/motor-experts/)

## Project Goals

- Showcase my understanding and knowledge of HTML and CSS
- Build a static front-end application with a simple and easy to follow UI

## Site Structure

Motor Experts is a 3 page website, with the home page being the default loading page. All other pages are accessed from the navigation bar at any given time. 

## Colour Scheme

My colour scheme will follow a simple, yet stylish aesthetic using greys and greens. I used [Colormind](http://colormind.io/) to generate random colour palettes to find the initial colour. From there I used [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/) to create a variety of colour palettes based off of one colour that I provided. 

Final Colour Palette:
