        <h2 id="h2-header">How Long Do Tyres Last?</h2>
        <p id="paragraph">The tread on car tyres wears down as you use them, which means you’ll have less grip on the road. When they wear down too much, you’ll have to replace them.<br>
            Find out how long the average tyre lasts and what to think about when you buy new car tyres.</p>

        <h3 id="h3-header">A Tyre's Lifespan</h3>
        <p id="paragraph">How long a tyre lasts depends on how its driven and stored. Under normal driving conditions, you should get a minimum of 20,000 miles out of front tyres on a front-wheel-drive car.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="paragraph">For rear tyres, it can be double that - around 40,000 miles. We recommend moving worn rear tyres to the front when the front ones wear out.</p>

        <h3 id="h3-header">How Does Wear Affect Tyre Lifespan?</h3>
        <p id="paragraph">As you drive, the tread on your tyres will start to wear. Some factors have a big impact on how long tyres last before they wear down. 
            <ul id="list">
                <li><strong>Vehicle Weight</strong> - Heavier cars wear tyres faster, and carrying excess weight around will cause faster tyre wear.</li>
                <li><strong>Driving Style</strong> - Aggressive cornering and braking increases wear.</li>
                <li><strong>Position</strong> - The driven wheels wear faster, i.e. front wheels on a front-wheel-drive and rear wheels on a rear-wheel-drive.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed</strong> - Driving at high speeds increases temperature and wear.</li>
                <li><strong>Pressure</strong> - Under or over inflated tyres will wear quicker.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment</strong> - Tyres will wear quickly and unevenly if wheel alignment's wrong.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <section>
        <h3 id="h3-header">How Does Age Affect Tyre Lifespan?</h3>
        <p id="paragraph">If your vehicle doesn’t get driven much, it's possible for the tyres to need replacing due to ageing rather than wearing out:
            <ul id="list">
                <li>Tyres degrade naturally through exposure to heat, sunlight (ultraviolet or UV rays) and rain.</li>
                <li>Environmental damage can cause them to crack if tyres are left outside.</li>
                <li>The amount of damage depends on the exposure and the severity of the weather.</li>
                <li>They’ll last longer if they’re kept indoors in a garage out of the sun and rain.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p id="paragraph">Damage through ageing is more common with caravans, trailers and other vehicles that are only used occasionally.</p>
