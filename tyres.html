        <p class="paragraph">The tread on car tyres wears down as you use them, which means you’ll have less grip on the road. When they wear down too much, you’ll have to replace them.<br>
            Find out how long the average tyre lasts and what to think about when you buy new car tyres.</p>

    <section>
        <h3 class="h3-header">A Tyre's Lifespan</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">How long a tyre lasts depends on how its driven and stored. Under normal driving conditions, you should get a minimum of 20,000 miles out of front tyres on a front-wheel-drive car.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">For rear tyres, it can be double that - around 40,000 miles. We recommend moving worn rear tyres to the front when the front ones wear out.</p>

    <section>
        <h3 class="h3-header">How Does Wear Affect Tyre Lifespan?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">As you drive, the tread on your tyres will start to wear. Some factors have a big impact on how long tyres last before they wear down. 
            <ul class="list">
                <li><strong>Vehicle Weight</strong> - Heavier cars wear tyres faster, and carrying excess weight around will cause faster tyre wear.</li>
                <li><strong>Driving Style</strong> - Aggressive cornering and braking increases wear.</li>
                <li><strong>Position</strong> - The driven wheels wear faster, i.e. front wheels on a front-wheel-drive and rear wheels on a rear-wheel-drive.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed</strong> - Driving at high speeds increases temperature and wear.</li>
                <li><strong>Pressure</strong> - Under or over inflated tyres will wear quicker.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment</strong> - Tyres will wear quickly and unevenly if wheel alignment's wrong.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <section>
        <h3 class="h3-header">How Does Age Affect Tyre Lifespan?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">If your vehicle doesn’t get driven much, it's possible for the tyres to need replacing due to ageing rather than wearing out:
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Tyres degrade naturally through exposure to heat, sunlight (ultraviolet or UV rays) and rain.</li>
                <li>Environmental damage can cause them to crack if tyres are left outside.</li>
                <li>The amount of damage depends on the exposure and the severity of the weather.</li>
                <li>They’ll last longer if they’re kept indoors in a garage out of the sun and rain.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Damage through ageing is more common with caravans, trailers and other vehicles that are only used occasionally.</p>

    <section>
        <h3 class="h3-header">How Can I Check How Old My Tyres Are?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">You can find out how old your tyres are by checking for a code on the side of the tyre. 
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Check the sidewall for the letters DOT.</li>
                <li>Next to this, there’ll be a 4 digit number code.</li>
                <li>The first pair of numbers is the week of manufacture.</li>
                <li>The second pair of numbers is the year of manufacture.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>For example, 0720 means the 7th week of 2020.</strong></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Tyres manufactured after 2000 have a 4 digit code. If you see a 3 digit code, this means they were made before 2000 and should be replaced immediately.</p>

    <section>
        <h3 class="h3-header">When Should You Replace The Tyres On Your Car?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">Aim to replace your car tyres when the tread depth gets below 3mm and before it gets below 2mm.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Tyres don’t usually last long enough to be replaced due to old age. Usually, the tyre tread wears down quicker than that. For older tyres, you can:
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Check for signs of cracking on the sidewalls of tyres 4 or 5 years old if your car's parked outside.</li>
                <li>Replace them if the cracking’s severe.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Any car tyre specialist will be able to give you advice if you're not sure.</p>
